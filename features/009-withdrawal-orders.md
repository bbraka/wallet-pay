add withdrawal orders - a user can request to withdraw their own funds, and admin can return funds to the user (opposite of Top Up). add this to the service, and also add it to the orders api endpoint. also add it as an option in the orders admin area. update the dusk and unit tests. a merchant can only withdraw from their own accout, an admin can refund money from all accounts. check if we already have this functionality covered. check if the orders types and statuses have it covered. add any necessary types or statuses and enums to constants. Make sure users can't withdraw more money when they have.

Create a new submenu in the admin orders section where all pending payments and withdrawals are listed. the table should be a table with a checkbox column and a button above the table which opens a confirmation modal, to confirm that you approve all the checked payments. The table should also have a button column for denying payments individually. Show a confirmation alert before approving a denial of an order. This would cancel the order. Order the table by order ASC - oldest orders first.

Also need an edit to the orders service and table. Add a payment_completion_date column which is a datetime to be filled when the status of an order changes to complete. Use an event listener to set that column. Put that in the migration for the withdrawal orders as well.
