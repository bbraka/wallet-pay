create the react page for login where a user can enter the client area. this can only be accessed by merchants. use the open api endpoints to create the necessary requests. Use a clean design for the login page - the app name, and a form with the username and password which sends a request to the api endpoint. If login is successful, then send the user to the wallet page.
To create the pages and components, use the Yii2 designs in the "wallet template" folder as a reference and follow this design but in a modern react way, and keeping in mind the database structure of our transactions table. In addition to the list of transactions for the user we need the following pages: a page to create a top-up order, a page to make a transfer to another user, and a page to make a withdrawal request. We need a profile menu in the top right where a user can see their name, and e-mail, and have the option to log-out.
