Now create the frontend endpoints required for user authentication. Utilize the RBAC tables and backpack functionalities we have to test if a user is allowed access to login.
We need a login endpoint which stores the token. Store the sessions in the database, like the admin area (use the same sessions for merchant area and admin area). Logging out should not be necessary as we would only need to delete the token on the client side, and that should be enough. Correct me if I'm wrong on that. Also add a user info endpoint, which would serve to create the profile menu in the frontend - this returns the user model. Create Open AI annotations for the endpoint. Utilize the model schema annotations, which are already created.
We also need a user list endpoint which shows the user email, id, and name.
